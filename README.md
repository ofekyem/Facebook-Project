# Welcome to my Facebook Project

## What is this project?

This project was built during the course "Advanced Programming" which I took during my Computer Science degree.

I did this project with two friends from the degree program, and the main idea of the project was to create a look-alike Facebook Android app and Facebook website that work the same as the original Facebook.

The project was originally made in four phases, and this repo unites the whole process and shows the final result.

In this app, you can perform the same features that are available on the original Facebook platform, such as creating a user, adding a post, adding a comment to a post, making friends, and more.

This project was made with the programming languages C++, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and Java.

It was also developed in a React environment and uses a Node.js server.

The main software used to create this website were VS Code, Android Studio, and MongoDB.

## How can I run it myself?

For running this whole project in a comfortable way, you can read the Wiki step by step.

There is a full explanation there for the entire installation and running process. 

So please, Read The Wiki!

## It's too long! Can you summarize this whole project?

Well, if you just want to see what my website and app can do without running it yourself, my friends and I made two videos: one for the Android app and one for the website. These videos show what each app can do!
