# Welcome to my Facebook Project

## What is this project?

This project was developed during the "Advanced Programming" course, which I took as part of my Computer Science degree at Bar-Ilan University.

I worked on this project with two friends from my degree program. The main idea of the project was to create a Clone of Facebook Android app and website that function similarly to the original Facebook.

The project was originally made in four phases, and this repository unites the whole process and showcases the final result.

In this app, you can perform the same features available on the original Facebook platform, such as creating a user, adding a post, adding a comment to a post, making friends, and more.

This project was developed using C++, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and Java.

It was also built in a React environment and uses a Node.js server.

The main software tools used to create this website were VS Code, Android Studio, and MongoDB.

## How can I run it myself?

For running this whole project in a comfortable way, you can read the Wiki step by step.

There is a full explanation there for the entire installation and running process. 

So please, Read The Wiki!

## It's too long! Can you summarize this whole project?

Well, if you just want to see what the website and the Android app can do without running it yourself, my friends and I made two videos: one for the Android app and one for the website. These videos show what each app can do!
