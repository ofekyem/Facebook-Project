# Welcome to our Advanced Programming course project in BIU 

We did this course in our second year of the C.S degree in BIU, and this project was built throughout the whole course. 

The main idea of this project was to create a facebook android app and website, and in addition it also works with a node js server, a tcp server and a bloom filter.

This project had 4 phases:
* the first one was building a bloom filter in C++
* the second one was building React website and an Android App of Facebook. 
* the third one was building a Node js server and connect the app and the website to it. 
* the fourth one was building a TCP server and connecting the bloom filter, Node js server, app and website all together. 

Here you will see our whole project finished, and we will give you instructions to how to run each part in order to make the whole facebook work. 

We will also explain about each thing what can it do and how it is working, so read all the pages carefully. 

We also recommend you to read the ReadMe.md files of each repository that we will navigate you.

## it's too long! can you summarize it? 
Well, if you just want to see what our webstie and app can do without running it yourself, we made 2 videos one for the android app and one for the webstie 
and those videos show what each app can do. We recommend you to watch those videos first.
